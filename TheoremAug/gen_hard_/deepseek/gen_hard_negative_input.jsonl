Each critical point is located at an integer distance `x_i` meters from the start of the pipeline (where `0 < x_i < N`).  \n\nTo make a connection at a critical point, the city must cut the pipeline at that point. The cost of cutting the pipeline at a point `x_i` is equal to the current length of the segment being cut. For example, if the pipeline is currently a single segment of length 10, cutting it at `x_i = 3` will cost 10, resulting in two segments of lengths 3 and 7.  \n\nThe city wants to determine the minimum total cost to make all the required connections at the critical points.

Your goal is to select a subset of tickets to maximize the total **score**, where the score of a subset is calculated as:  \n```\nscore = sum(priority[i] * customer_value[i] for all selected tickets[i])\n```  \n\nHowever, there is an additional constraint:  \n- You cannot select more than `K` tickets from customers with `customer_value` less than or equal to `V` (a given threshold).  \n\nGiven a list of `N` tickets, the total time `T`, the threshold `V`, and the limit `K`, determine the maximum achievable score.  \n\n**Input Format**  \nThe first line contains four integers: `N`, `T`, `V`, `K`.  \nThe next `N` lines each contain three integers: `priority`, `time_needed`, `customer_value`.  \n\n**Constraints**  \n- `1 ≤ N ≤ 100`  \n- `1 ≤ T ≤ 1000`  \n- `1 ≤ V ≤ 1000`  \n- `0 ≤ K ≤ N`  \n- `1 ≤ priority[i], customer_value[i] ≤ 1000`  \n- `1 ≤ time_needed[i] ≤ 1000`  \n\n**Output Format**  \nPrint the maximum achievable score.  \n\n**Example Input**  \n```\n4 10 5 1\n3 4 6\n2 5 4\n4 3 5\n1 2 3\n```  \n\n**Example Output**  \n```\n27\n```  \n\n**Explanation**  \nThe optimal selection is tickets 1 and 3 (0-indexed). Their total time is 4 + 3 = 7 ≤ 10, and only 1 ticket (ticket 3) has `customer_value` ≤ 5, which satisfies `K = 1`. The score is 3*6 + 4*5 = 18 + 20 = 38. Wait, no—the example output is 27. Let me recheck:  \nWait, the correct selection is tickets 0 and 2: priority 3 and 4, customer_value 6 and 5. Time 4 + 3 = 7. Score = 3*6 + 4*5 = 18 + 20 = 38. But the example output is 27, which suggests the correct selection is tickets 1 and 2: priority 2 and 4, customer_value 4 and 5. Time 5 + 3 = 8. Score = 2*4 + 4*5 = 8 + 20 = 28. Hmm, this is confusing. Perhaps the example is incorrect.

The network connections between these servers are represented as a directed graph where each edge from server `u` to server `v` has a reliability score `r(u, v)`, which is a floating-point number between `0.0` and `1.0` (inclusive). The reliability score represents the probability that a message sent from `u` will successfully reach `v` directly. If no direct connection exists between `u` and `v`, the reliability is considered `0.0`.\n\nYour task is to compute the most reliable path between every pair of servers `(u, v)`. The reliability of a path is the product of the reliability scores of the edges along that path.

Each station is connected to others via directed pathways, each with a **difficulty score** (a positive integer). A higher score means the transition is more challenging.  \n\nYou are given a directed graph representing the pathways between `N` stations (labeled `0` to `N-1`). The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix `diff`, where `diff[i][j]` is the difficulty of moving from station `i` to `j`. If no direct pathway exists, `diff[i][j] = 0`.  \n\nYour task is to compute the **safest difficulty matrix**, where `safest[i][j]` is the **minimum maximum difficulty** of any path from station `i` to `j`. In other words, among all possible paths from `i` to `j`, choose the one where the highest difficulty edge is as small as possible. If no path exists, `safest[i][j] = 0`.  \n\nWrite a function `compute_safest_difficulty(diff)` that returns the safest difficulty matrix.  \n\n#### **Input**  \n- A square matrix `diff` of size `N x N` (`1 ≤ N ≤ 100`).  \n- Each `diff[i][j]` is an integer where `0 ≤ diff[i][j] ≤ 10^6`.  \n\n#### **Output**  \nReturn the safest difficulty matrix as a 2D list.  \n\n#### **Example**  \n\n**Input:**  \n```\ndiff = [\n    [0, 8, 0, 5],\n    [0, 0, 2, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 6],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```  \n\n**Output:**  \n```\n[\n    [0, 8, 2, 5],\n    [0, 0, 2, 2],\n    [0, 0, 0, 6],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```  \n\n**Explanation:**  \n- From station `0` to `2`, the path `0 → 1 → 2` has difficulties `8` and `2`, so the max difficulty is `8`. However, another path `0 → 3 → 2` (if it existed) might have a lower max. Here, the only path has `max(8, 2) = 8`.  \n- From station `1` to `3`, the path `1 → 2 → 3` has max difficulty `max(2, 6) = 6`, but the direct path `1 → 3` doesn't exist, so the safest is `6`.\n\n**Positive Document**\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Marketplace Delivery Network\n    \n    This program computes the minimum delivery time between pairs of warehouses in a directed graph,\n    where edges can have negative weights but no negative cycles exist.

Determine the minimum total cost required to connect all warehouses.  \n\n**Input Format**  \n- The first line contains an integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000), the number of warehouses.  \n- The next `N` lines each contain two integers `x` and `y` (-10^6 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^6), the coordinates of the warehouses.  \n\n**Output Format**  \n- Print a single floating-point number representing the minimum total cost to connect all warehouses. The output should be rounded to two decimal places.  \n\n**Example**  \nInput:  \n```\n4\n0 0\n1 1\n1 0\n0 1\n```  \nOutput:  \n```\n3.00\n```  \n\n**Explanation**  \nThe optimal connections are between (0,0)-(1,0), (1,0)-(1,1), and (1,1)-(0,1), with a total cost of 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n\n**Positive Document**\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Problem: Village Fiber Optic Network\n    \n    Description:\n    In a remote region, there are N villages labeled from 1 to N.

The comparison should be case-insensitive and ignore all non-alphabetic characters (only letters a-z should be considered).\n\n**Input:**\n- The first line contains three integers: *n* (number of corpus documents, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100), *m* (length of the suspicious document, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), and *k* (substring length, 1 ≤ k ≤ m).\n- The next *n* lines contain the corpus documents, each with length up to 10^5.\n- The last line contains the suspicious document.\n\n**Output:**\n- Print all unique substrings of length *k* from the suspicious document that appear in any corpus document, in the order they first appear in the suspicious document. Each substring should be printed in lowercase.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- The total length of all corpus documents does not exceed 10^6.\n- The solution must efficiently handle the upper constraint limits.\n\n**Example:**\n\nInput:\n```\n2 10 3\nHello world\nCode Jam is fun\nHello, Code Jam!\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nhel\nell\nllo\ncod\node\njam\n```\n\n**Positive Document**\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Problem: Customer Support Message Filter\n\n    You are working on a customer support system that handles a large volume of messages.

On this day, customers can get discounts on products whose prices are prime numbers. To prepare for the event, you need to analyze the product catalog efficiently.  \n\nGiven a list of `n` product prices, you need to answer `q` queries. Each query provides a range `[L, R]` (1-based indexing) and asks for the count of products in that range whose prices are prime numbers.  \n\n**Input:**  \n- The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6), the number of products.  \n- The second line contains `n` space-separated integers `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n` (1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 10^6), the prices of the products.  \n- The third line contains an integer `q` (1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^6), the number of queries.  \n- The next `q` lines each contain two integers `L` and `R` (1 ≤ `L` ≤ `R` ≤ `n`), representing the range for the query.  \n\n**Output:**  \nFor each query, output the count of products in the range `[L, R]` whose prices are prime numbers.  \n\n**Example:**  \nInput:  \n```\n5\n2 3 4 5 6\n3\n1 3\n2 4\n4 5\n```  \nOutput:  \n```\n2\n2\n1\n```  \n\n**Explanation:**  \n- For the first query, the prices in range [1, 3] are [2, 3, 4].

A company may forward a request to another company if they cannot handle it themselves. This creates a directed network where nodes represent companies and edges represent forwarding relationships.\n\nA \"strongly connected\" group of companies is one where every company can forward requests to every other company in the group, either directly or through intermediaries. Such groups are highly reliable because requests can be circulated within the group without needing external companies.\n\nGiven the forwarding network as a directed graph, your task is to identify the number of strongly connected groups and the size of the largest such group. \n\nWrite a function `analyze_customer_service(network)` where:\n- `network` is a dictionary representing the directed graph. Each key is a company (as a string), and the corresponding value is a list of companies it can forward requests to.\n- The function should return a tuple `(num_groups, largest_size)`, where `num_groups` is the total number of strongly connected groups, and `largest_size` is the number of companies in the largest group.\n\n**Example:**\n```\nnetwork = {\n    'A': ['B'],\n    'B': ['C'],\n    'C': ['A', 'D'],\n    'D': ['E'],\n    'E': ['D']\n}\nanalyze_customer_service(network)  # should return (2, 3)\n```\nExplanation: The strongly connected groups are `{'A', 'B', 'C'}` and `{'D', 'E'}`.

If no such path exists, return `-1`.  \n\n**Input**  \n- The first line contains four integers: `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 20), `m` (1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n*(n-1)`), `start`, and `end` (0 ≤ `start`, `end` ≤ `n-1`, `start` ≠ `end`), where `n` is the number of planets, `m` is the number of wormholes, and `start` and `end` are the starting and destination planets, respectively.  \n- The next `m` lines each contain three integers `u`, `v`, and `c` (0 ≤ `u`, `v` ≤ `n-1`, `u` ≠ `v`, 0 ≤ `c` ≤ 10^6), representing a one-way wormhole from planet `u` to planet `v` with cost `c`.  \n\n**Output**  \nPrint a single integer: the minimum total cost of a path from `start` to `end` that visits every planet exactly once, or `-1` if no such path exists.  \n\n**Example**  \nInput:  \n```\n4 6 0 3\n0 1 1\n1 2 2\n2 3 3\n0 2 5\n1 3 6\n2 0 4\n```  \nOutput:  \n```\n6\n```  \nExplanation: The path `0 → 1 → 2 → 3` has a total cost of `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is the minimum possible.\n\n**Positive Document**\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traffic Network Inspection\n    \n    In the city of Gridburg, the traffic authority wants to inspect all major intersections in a single route without revisiting any intersection.

Each ticket has two attributes:  \n- **Priority Level (P)**: An integer between 1 and 5 (inclusive), where 1 is the highest priority.  \n- **Processing Time (T)**: An integer representing the time (in minutes) required to resolve the ticket.  \n\nThe support team has `K` agents, and each agent can work on exactly one ticket at a time. The goal is to assign tickets to agents such that the **total waiting time** is minimized.

In other words, tickets of the same priority cannot be processed concurrently by different agents.  \n\nGiven the list of tickets and the number of agents `K`, determine the minimum possible total waiting time.  \n\n#### Input  \nThe first line contains two integers `N` and `K` (1 ≤ `K` ≤ `N` ≤ 10), where `N` is the number of tickets and `K` is the number of agents.  \nThe next `N` lines each contain two integers `P` and `T`, representing the priority level and processing time of the ticket.  \n\n#### Output  \nPrint a single integer representing the minimum possible total waiting time.  \n\n#### Example  \n**Input:**  \n```\n4 2\n1 5\n2 3\n1 2\n2 4\n```  \n**Output:**  \n```\n22\n```  \n**Explanation:**  \nOne optimal assignment is:  \n- Agent 1: [1 (5), 1 (2)] → completion times: 5, 5+2=7  \n- Agent 2: [2 (3), 2 (4)] → completion times: 3, 3+4=7  \nTotal waiting time = 5 + 7 + 3 + 7 = 22.  \n\n---\n\n**Positive Document**\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef count_learning_paths(n, k, difficulty):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of distinct learning paths of length k where each subsequent course is strictly more difficult.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): Number of courses (1 ≤ n ≤ 12).\n        k (int): Length of the learning path (1 ≤ k ≤ n).\n        difficulty (list[int]): List of difficulties for each course (all distinct).\n\n    Returns:\n        int: Number of valid learning paths modulo 10^9 + 7.\n    \"\"\"\n    from itertools import combinations\n\n    count = 0\n    for seq in combinations(difficulty, k):\n        is_increasing = True\n        for i in range(k - 1):\n            if seq[i] >= seq[i + 1]:\n                is_increasing = False\n                break\n        if is_increasing:\n            count += 1\n\n    return count % MOD\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    difficulty = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))\n    \n    result = count_learning_paths(n, k, difficulty)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n\nDirectly response the content of hard negative document without explanation.\n**Hard Negative Document**\n"}], "max_tokens": 4000}}

Your goal is to maximize the total power of the assembled relics while respecting the elemental restrictions.  \n\nGiven the list of relics, their binary strings, and their powers, determine the maximum total power achievable.  \n\n**Input:**  \n- The first line contains two integers `n` and `m` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 20`, `1 ≤ m ≤ 20`).  \n- The next `n` lines each contain a binary string `s_i` (of length `m`) and an integer `p_i` (`1 ≤ p_i ≤ 10^6`).  \n\n**Output:**  \nPrint a single integer, the maximum total power.  \n\n**Example:**  \nInput:  \n```\n4 3\n110 10\n001 5\n101 8\n010 3\n```  \nOutput:  \n```\n13\n```\n\n**Positive Document**\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Problem: Logistics Fleet Deployment\n\n    A logistics company needs to deploy a fleet of drones to deliver packages to `N` warehouses.

The input consists of:\n- The first line contains two integers `N` and `Q`, the number of products and the number of queries, respectively.\n- The second line contains `N` integers, the initial `views` array.\n- The next `Q` lines each contain a query in the format described above.\n\nFor each `QUERY` operation, output the total number of views in the specified range.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- 1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000\n- 1 ≤ Q ≤ 100,000\n- 0 ≤ views[i] ≤ 1,000,000\n- For `UPDATE` queries, 0 ≤ X ≤ 1,000,000\n- For `QUERY` and `UPDATE` queries, 0 ≤ L ≤ R < N\n\n**Example Input:**\n```\n5 3\n1 2 3 4 5\nQUERY 1 3\nUPDATE 1 3 2\nQUERY 1 3\n```\n\n**Example Output:**\n```\n9\n15\n```\n\n**Positive Document**\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(num):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is a perfect square.\"\"\"\n    root = int(math.isqrt(num))\n    return root * root == num\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Problem Description:\n    You are tasked with designing a system to monitor and analyze network traffic in real-time.

Each orb can be classified as either a *Lightbringer* or a *Shadowcaster* based on two properties:  \n1. **Pulse Frequency** (measured in kHz)  \n2. **Energy Amplitude** (measured in lumens)  \n\nThe orbs' properties are recorded as 2D points (Frequency, Amplitude). The Arcanum scholars have observed that the orbs can be separated into their two classes by a straight line in the 2D plane. However, some orbs are \"tricky\" and lie very close to the boundary, making the classification challenging.  \n\nYour task is to write a program that, given a set of training data (known orb classifications), finds the optimal boundary line to classify new orbs with the maximum possible margin from the nearest orbs of both classes.  \n\n#### Input:  \n- A list of training samples, where each sample is a tuple `(frequency, amplitude, class)`. The `class` is either `0` (Lightbringer) or `1` (Shadowcaster).  \n- A list of query samples to classify, where each sample is a tuple `(frequency, amplitude)`.  \n\n#### Output:  \n- For each query sample, output `0` (Lightbringer) or `1` (Shadowcaster) based on the optimal boundary line learned from the training data.  \n\n#### Example:  \n**Training Data:**  \n`[(1.0, 2.0, 0), (2.0, 1.0, 0), (3.0, 3.0, 1), (4.0, 2.0, 1)]`  \n\n**Query Samples:**  \n`[(2.5, 2.0), (1.5, 1.5)]`  \n\n**Expected Output:**  \n`[1, 0]`  \n\n**Note:** Your solution should efficiently find the boundary line that maximizes the margin between the two classes.  \n\n---\n\n**Positive Document**\n\"\"\"\nProblem: Optimal Crop Separation\n\nIn modern agriculture, it's crucial to separate different crops efficiently based on their characteristics to maximize yield and minimize cross-contamination.

The total combined length of all keywords does not exceed `10^6`.  \n- The last line contains the product description `D` (`1 ≤ |D| ≤ 10^6`).  \n\n**Output**  \nPrint `N` lines, where the `i`-th line contains the number of occurrences of the `i`-th keyword in `D`.  \n\n**Example**  \nInput:  \n```\n3\nfoo\nbar\nbaz\nfoobarbazfoo\n```  \nOutput:  \n```\n2\n1\n1\n```\n\n**Positive Document**\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass AhoCorasickNode:\n    __slots__ = ['transitions', 'fail', 'output']\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.transitions = {}\n        self.fail = None\n        self.output = set()\n\ndef build_automaton(keywords):\n    root = AhoCorasickNode()\n    \n    # Build trie\n    for keyword in keywords:\n        node = root\n        for char in keyword:\n            if char not in node.transitions:\n                node.transitions[char] = AhoCorasickNode()\n            node = node.transitions[char]\n        node.output.add(keyword)\n    \n    # Build failure links using BFS\n    queue = deque()\n    root.fail = root\n    for char, node in root.transitions.items():\n        node.fail = root\n        queue.append(node)\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_node = queue.popleft()\n        for char, next_node in current_node.transitions.items():\n            fail_node = current_node.fail\n            while fail_node != root and char not in fail_node.transitions:\n                fail_node = fail_node.fail\n            if char in fail_node.transitions:\n                next_node.fail = fail_node.transitions[char]\n            else:\n                next_node.fail = root\n            next_node.output.update(next_node.fail.output)\n            queue.append(next_node)\n    \n    return root\n\ndef search_keywords(automaton, text, keyword_set):\n    found_keywords = set()\n    current_node = automaton\n    for char in text:\n        while current_node != automaton and char not in current_node.transitions:\n            current_node = current_node.fail\n        if char in current_node.transitions:\n            current_node = current_node.transitions[char]\n        found_keywords.update(current_node.output)\n    \n    return [keyword for keyword in keyword_set if keyword in found_keywords]\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    N = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    keywords = []\n    keyword_set = set()\n    for _ in range(N):\n        keyword = input[idx].strip()\n        keywords.append(keyword)\n        keyword_set.add(keyword)\n        idx += 1\n    \n    automaton = build_automaton(keywords)\n    \n    M = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    for _ in range(M):\n        log = input[idx].strip()\n        idx += 1\n        found = search_keywords(automaton, log, keyword_set)\n        # Preserve the order of keywords as per input\n        ordered_found = [kw for kw in keywords if kw in found]\n        print(' '.join(ordered_found))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n\nDirectly response the content of hard negative document without explanation.\n**Hard Negative Document**\n"}], "max_tokens": 4000}}

Each agent can only handle requests that match or are below their skill level, and no agent can handle more requests than their capacity.  \n\nGiven the following:  \n- A list of agents, where each agent is represented by a tuple `(skill_level, capacity)`.  \n- A list of customers, where each customer is represented by a tuple `(request_skill, num_requests)`.  \n\nYour task is to determine the maximum number of requests that can be handled per hour by optimally assigning customer requests to agents.  \n\n**Input Format:**  \n- The first line contains two integers, `A` and `C`, representing the number of agents and customers, respectively.  \n- The next `A` lines contain two integers each, `s_i` and `cap_i`, representing the skill level and capacity of the `i-th` agent.  \n- The next `C` lines contain two integers each, `r_j` and `num_j`, representing the required skill level and number of requests of the `j-th` customer.  \n\n**Output Format:**  \n- A single integer representing the maximum number of requests that can be handled per hour.  \n\n**Constraints:**  \n- `1 ≤ A, C ≤ 100`  \n- `1 ≤ s_i, r_j ≤ 10^6`  \n- `1 ≤ cap_i, num_j ≤ 10^4`  \n\n**Example:**  \nInput:  \n```\n3 2  \n5 10  \n3 5  \n4 8  \n4 6  \n5 7  \n```  \nOutput:  \n```\n13  \n```  \n\n**Explanation:**  \n- The first agent (skill 5, capacity 10) can handle all requests from both customers (skill 4 and 5).  \n- The second agent (skill 3, capacity 5) cannot handle any requests (skill 4 and 5 > 3).  \n- The third agent (skill 4, capacity 8) can handle requests from the first customer (skill 4).  \n- The optimal assignment is:  \n  - Assign 6 requests (skill 4) to the third agent.  \n  - Assign 7 requests (skill 5) to the first agent.  \nTotal requests handled: 6 + 7 = 13.\n\n**Positive Document**\n\"\"\"\nProblem: Optimal Irrigation Network\n\nIn a large agricultural region, there are multiple farms connected by a network of irrigation channels.

Each product requires a sequence of operations, and each operation is performed by a specific machine. The machines are arranged in a sequence, and the cost of transferring a product between two consecutive machines depends on their compatibility. \n\nThe company has identified that the order in which operations are grouped can significantly impact the total transfer cost. Given the dimensions of `n` machines as an array `dims`, where machine `i` has dimensions `dims[i] x dims[i+1]`, the transfer cost between machine `i` and machine `j` is calculated as `dims[i] * dims[j] * dims[k]`, where `k` is the intermediate machine. \n\nYour task is to determine the minimum total transfer cost required to perform all operations in the assembly line. \n\n**Input**  \n- An integer `n` representing the number of machines (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).  \n- An array `dims` of size `n+1`, where each element is an integer (1 ≤ dims[i] ≤ 100).  \n\n**Output**  \n- Return the minimum total transfer cost.  \n\n**Example**  \nInput:  \n```\nn = 4\ndims = [10, 30, 5, 60]\n```\nOutput:  \n```\n4500\n```\nExplanation:  \nThe optimal grouping is `(10x30, 30x5)` and `(30x5, 5x60)`, with costs `10*30*5 = 1500` and `30*5*60 = 9000`. The total cost is `1500 + 9000 = 10500`. However, another grouping `((10x30x5)x60)` yields a lower total cost of `10*5*60 + 10*30*60 = 300 + 18000 = 18300`. The minimum is `4500` when grouped as `(10x(30x5x60))` with costs `30*5*60 = 9000` and `10*30*60 = 18000`, totaling `9000 + 18000 = 27000` is incorrect.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of partitions required to divide the crop row into sections where each section's growth pattern is symmetric.  \n\nFor example:  \n- If `s = \"ABAC\"`, the optimal partition is `\"ABA|C\"`, requiring 1 partition.  \n- If `s = \"AABB\"`, the optimal partition is `\"AA|BB\"`, requiring 1 partition.  \n- If `s = \"ABCD\"`, no partitions will make symmetric sections except partitioning each character individually, requiring 3 partitions (e.g., `\"A|B|C|D\"`).  \n\nWrite a function `min_partitions(s: str) -> int` that returns the minimum number of partitions needed.  \n\n**Constraints**:  \n- `1 <= len(s) <= 2000`  \n- `s` consists only of uppercase English letters.\n\n**Positive Document**\ndef min_palindrome_cuts(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a string `s`, partition the string into substrings such that every substring is a palindrome.\n    Return the minimum number of cuts needed to partition the string accordingly.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The minimum number of cuts required.\n\n    Constraints:\n        1 <= len(s) <= 2000\n        s consists of lowercase English letters only.\n\n    Examples:\n        >>> min_palindrome_cuts(\"aab\")\n        1\n        >>> min_palindrome_cuts(\"a\")\n        0\n        >>> min_palindrome_cuts(\"ab\")\n        1\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(s)\n    is_palindrome = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    dp = [0] * n\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        is_palindrome[i][i] = True\n\n    for length in range(2, n + 1):\n        for i in range(n - length + 1):\n            j = i + length - 1\n            if s[i] == s[j]:\n                if length == 2 or is_palindrome[i + 1][j - 1]:\n                    is_palindrome[i][j] = True\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if is_palindrome[0][i]:\n            dp[i] = 0\n        else:\n            dp[i] = float('inf')\n            for j in range(i):\n                if is_palindrome[j + 1][i] and dp[j] + 1 < dp[i]:\n                    dp[i] = dp[j] + 1\n\n    return dp[n - 1]\n\n\nDirectly response the content of hard negative document without explanation.\n**Hard Negative Document**\n"}], "max_tokens": 4000}}

The distances between the checkpoints are as follows: AB = 120 meters, BC = 60 meters, and CD = 90 meters. A runner can take either the direct path AC or the path ADC (via point D) to go from A to C. If the runner takes the path ADC, the distance is exactly 1.5 times the direct distance AC. What is the distance between checkpoints A and C?\nLet the distance between A and C be \\( x \\) meters.

If the gardener plants 120 flowers along \\(AP\\), 90 flowers along \\(BP\\), and \\(x\\) flowers along \\(CP\\), determine the value of \\(x\\).\nLet the lengths of the segments be:  \n- \\(BD:DC = 2:3\\), so let \\(BD = 2k\\) and \\(DC = 3k\\).  \n- \\(CE:EA = 4:1\\), so let \\(CE = 4m\\) and \\(EA = m\\).  \n- \\(AF:FB = m:n\\) (to be determined).  \n\nBy Ceva's Theorem, the product of the ratios is 1:  \n\\[\n\\frac{BD}{DC} \\cdot \\frac{CE}{EA} \\cdot \\frac{AF}{FB} = 1 \\implies \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{1} \\cdot \\frac{m}{n} = 1 \\implies \\frac{8m}{3n} = 1 \\implies \\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{3}{8}.\n\\]  \nThus, \\(AF:FB = 3:8\\).  \n\nThe number of flowers planted along \\(AP\\), \\(BP\\), and \\(CP\\) is proportional to their lengths.

Thus:  \n\\[\n\\frac{7}{3}b = 210 \\implies b = 90 \\implies a = 120.\n\\]  \n\nNow, using the length ratios from Ceva's Theorem and the flower proportionality:  \n\\[\n\\frac{c}{x} = \\frac{a}{120} = 1 \\implies c = x.\n\\]  \n\nTo find \\(c\\), observe that the area ratios imply:  \n\\[\n\\frac{c}{a} = \\frac{CP}{AP} = \\frac{\\text{Area of } \\triangle BPC}{\\text{Area of } \\triangle APB} \\cdot \\frac{AP}{CP}.\n\\]  \nHowever, a simpler approach is to use the flower proportionality directly:  \nSince \\(a + b + c\\) corresponds to \\(120 + 90 + x\\), and \\(a + b = 210\\), we have:  \n\\[\nc = x.\n\\]  \n\nBut from the area ratios and Ceva's Theorem, the exact value of \\(c\\) can be derived as follows:  \nThe ratio of the areas is:  \n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Area of } \\triangle APB}{\\text{Area of } \\triangle ABC} = \\frac{AF}{AB} = \\frac{3}{11}.\n\\]  \nSimilarly:  \n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Area of } \\triangle BPC}{\\text{Area of } \\triangle ABC} = \\frac{BD}{BC} = \\frac{2}{5}.\n\\]  \nThus:  \n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Area of } \\triangle CPA}{\\text{Area of } \\triangle ABC} = 1 - \\frac{3}{11} - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{55 - 15 - 22}{55} = \\frac{18}{55}.\n\\]  \n\nThe lengths \\(AP\\), \\(BP\\), and \\(CP\\) are proportional to the heights of these triangles, so:  \n\\[\n\\frac{a}{\\text{Area of } \\triangle BPC} = \\frac{b}{\\text{Area of } \\triangle CPA} = \\frac{c}{\\text{Area of } \\triangle APB}.\n\\]  \nSubstituting the known areas:  \n\\[\n\\frac{a}{2/5} = \\frac{b}{18/55} = \\frac{c}{3/11}.\n\\]  \nFrom \\(a = 120\\) and \\(b = 90\\):  \n\\[\n\\frac{120}{2/5} = 300 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{90}{18/55} = 275.\n\\]  \nThus:  \n\\[\n\\frac{c}{3/11} = 275 \\implies c = 275 \\cdot \\frac{3}{11} = 75.\n\\]  \n\nTherefore, \\(x = c = 75\\).  \n\n\\(\\boxed{75}\\)\n\nDirectly response the content of hard negative document without explanation.\n**Hard Negative Document**\n"}], "max_tokens": 4000}}

Each bridge connects exactly two distinct landmarks and can be traversed in both directions. The city council wants to install security cameras at some landmarks such that every bridge is monitored—meaning at least one of the two landmarks it connects has a camera. To minimize costs, they want to use as few cameras as possible.  \n\nHowever, there's a twist: the cameras at certain landmarks interfere with each other if they are too close. Specifically, no two landmarks with cameras can be connected by a bridge.  \n\nGiven the city's bridge network, what is the smallest number of cameras needed to monitor all bridges while satisfying the interference constraint?  \n\nFor the specific case where the landmarks and bridges form the following network:  \n- Landmarks: \\( A, B, C, D, E \\)  \n- Bridges: \\( A-B, A-C, B-C, B-D, C-E, D-E \\)  \n\nDetermine the smallest number of cameras required.\nWe need to select a subset of landmarks such that:  \n1. Every bridge has at least one of its endpoints selected (to monitor the bridge).  \n2. No two selected landmarks are connected by a bridge (no interference).  \n\nTo minimize the number of cameras, we seek the smallest such subset.  \n\nConsider the given network:  \n- Adjacency:  \n  - \\( A \\): \\( B, C \\)  \n  - \\( B \\): \\( A, C, D \\)  \n  - \\( C \\): \\( A, B, E \\)  \n  - \\( D \\): \\( B, E \\)  \n  - \\( E \\): \\( C, D \\)  \n\nWe can approach this by trial and reasoning:  \n1. Suppose we select \\( A \\). Then we cannot select \\( B \\) or \\( C \\) due to interference. The remaining bridges to monitor are \\( B-D, C-E, D-E \\). Selecting \\( D \\) would cover \\( B-D \\) and \\( D-E \\), but \\( C-E \\) remains uncovered. Selecting \\( E \\) would cover \\( C-E \\) and \\( D-E \\), but \\( B-D \\) remains uncovered. Thus, selecting \\( A \\) alone is insufficient, and we need at least two more cameras, totaling 3.  \n\n2. Suppose we select \\( B \\). Then we cannot select \\( A, C, \\) or \\( D \\). The remaining bridges to monitor are \\( A-C, C-E, D-E \\). Selecting \\( E \\) covers \\( C-E \\) and \\( D-E \\), but \\( A-C \\) remains uncovered. Selecting \\( C \\) is not allowed. Thus, this also requires at least 3 cameras.  \n\n3. Suppose we select \\( C \\). Then we cannot select \\( A, B, \\) or \\( E \\). The remaining bridges to monitor are \\( A-B, B-D, D-E \\). Selecting \\( D \\) covers \\( B-D \\) and \\( D-E \\), but \\( A-B \\) remains uncovered. Selecting \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) is not allowed. Thus, this also requires at least 3 cameras.  \n\n4. Suppose we select \\( D \\). Then we cannot select \\( B \\) or \\( E \\). The remaining bridges to monitor are \\( A-B, A-C, B-C, C-E \\). Selecting \\( C \\) covers \\( A-C, B-C, C-E \\), but \\( A-B \\) remains uncovered. Selecting \\( A \\) covers \\( A-B, A-C \\), but \\( B-C \\) and \\( C-E \\) remain uncovered. Thus, this requires at least 3 cameras.  \n\n5. Suppose we select \\( E \\). Then we cannot select \\( C \\) or \\( D \\). The remaining bridges to monitor are \\( A-B, A-C, B-C, B-D \\). Selecting \\( B \\) covers \\( A-B, B-C, B-D \\), but \\( A-C \\) remains uncovered. Selecting \\( C \\) is not allowed. Selecting \\( A \\) covers \\( A-B, A-C \\), but \\( B-C \\) and \\( B-D \\) remain uncovered. Thus, this also requires at least 3 cameras.  \n\n6. Now, consider selecting two non-adjacent landmarks:  \n   - \\( A \\) and \\( D \\): This covers \\( A-B, A-C, B-D, D-E \\). The uncovered bridges are \\( B-C, C-E \\). Adding \\( E \\) covers \\( C-E \\), but \\( B-C \\) remains uncovered. Adding \\( C \\) is not allowed. Thus, this requires 3 cameras but still leaves \\( B-C \\) uncovered.  \n   - \\( B \\) and \\( E \\): This covers \\( A-B, B-C, B-D, C-E, D-E \\). The uncovered bridge is \\( A-C \\). Adding \\( A \\) or \\( C \\) is not allowed. Thus, this requires 3 cameras but leaves \\( A-C \\) uncovered.  \n   - \\( C \\) and \\( D \\): This covers \\( A-C, B-C, B-D, D-E \\).

Specifically, no two landmarks with cameras can be connected by a bridge.  \n\nGiven the city's bridge network, what is the smallest number of cameras needed to monitor all bridges while satisfying the interference constraint?  \n\nFor the specific case where the landmarks and bridges form the following network:  \n- Landmarks: \\( A, B, C, D, E \\)  \n- Bridges: \\( A-B, A-C, B-C, B-D, C-E, D-E \\)  \n\nDetermine the smallest number of cameras required.\n\n**Positive Document**\nA music festival is setting up stages across a park with 5 stages connected by walking paths as follows:  \n- Stage 1 is connected to Stage 2 and Stage 3.  \n- Stage 2 is connected to Stage 1 and Stage 4.  \n- Stage 3 is connected to Stage 1 and Stage 5.  \n- Stage 4 is connected to Stage 2 and Stage 5.  \n- Stage 5 is connected to Stage 3 and Stage 4.  \n\nSecurity guards must be placed at stages such that every walking path is monitored by at least one guard. A guard at a stage can monitor all paths connected to that stage. What is the smallest number of guards needed to monitor all walking paths?\nTo minimize the number of guards, we select stages such that every path is monitored. One optimal solution is placing guards at Stage 2 and Stage 3:  \n- Stage 2 monitors paths 1-2 and 2-4.  \n- Stage 3 monitors paths 1-3 and 3-5.  \n- The remaining path 4-5 is monitored by Stage 4 or Stage 5, requiring an additional guard.  \n\nAlternatively, placing guards at Stage 1 and Stage 4:  \n- Stage 1 monitors paths 1-2 and 1-3.  \n- Stage 4 monitors paths 2-4 and 4-5.  \n- The remaining path 3-5 is monitored by Stage 3 or Stage 5, requiring an additional guard.  \n\nThe smallest number of guards needed is **2**, achieved by placing them at Stage 1 and Stage 5:  \n- Stage 1 monitors paths 1-2 and 1-3.  \n- Stage 5 monitors paths 3-5 and 4-5.  \n- The remaining path 2-4 is monitored by Stage 2 or Stage 4, requiring an additional guard.  \n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the minimal number of guards required is **3** (e.g., Stage 1, Stage 4, and Stage 3).  \n\nFinal answer: **2** is insufficient, so the answer is **3**.  \n\nUpon re-evaluation, the optimal solution is placing guards at **Stage 2 and Stage 5**:  \n- Stage 2 monitors paths 1-2 and 2-4.  \n- Stage 5 monitors paths 3-5 and 4-5.  \n- The remaining path 1-3 is monitored by Stage 1 or Stage 3, requiring an additional guard.  \n\nThus, the smallest number of guards needed is **3**.  \n\nFinal answer: **3**.\n\nDirectly response the content of hard negative document without explanation.\n**Hard Negative Document**\n"}], "max_tokens": 4000}}

We need to find the smallest number of users where it's impossible to avoid having either 4 users who all follow each other or 3 users who none follow each other.  \n\nBy systematically analyzing smaller groups:  \n- For a group of 5, it's possible to arrange relationships so neither condition is met.  \n- For a group of 6, the same holds true.  \n- Continuing this way, we find that for a group of 9, it's still possible to avoid both conditions.  \n\nHowever, for a group of 10, no matter how the relationships are arranged, one of the two conditions must hold. This is because any complete graph of 10 nodes with edges colored in two colors (representing follow or not follow) will always contain either a monochromatic clique of 4 (all following) or a monochromatic clique of 3 (none following).  \n\nThus, the smallest group size is **10**.\n\nDirectly response the content of hard negative document without explanation.\n**Hard Negative Document**\n"}], "max_tokens": 4000}}

Similarly, since \\( \\frac{N}{70} \\) is a perfect cube, \\( N \\) must include the primes in 70 with exponents that are 1 more than a multiple of 3.  \n\nThus, for \\( N \\):  \n- The exponent of 2 must satisfy \\( e_2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 2 \\) and \\( e_2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\). The smallest such \\( e_2 \\) is 1 (since 1 is the smallest number satisfying both conditions).  \n- The exponent of 3 must satisfy \\( e_3 \\equiv 1 \\mod 2 \\) (since 3 is not in 70). The smallest such \\( e_3 \\) is 1.  \n- The exponent of 5 must satisfy \\( e_5 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\) (since 5 is not in 42).

The smallest such \\( e_7 \\) is 1.  \n\nHowever, checking the exponents:  \nFor 2: \\( e_2 = 1 \\) works.  \nFor 3: \\( e_3 = 1 \\) works.  \nFor 5: \\( e_5 = 1 \\) works.  \nFor 7: \\( e_7 = 1 \\) does not work because \\( \\frac{N}{70} \\) would require \\( e_7 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\), but \\( e_7 = 1 \\) satisfies this.  \n\nBut wait, \\( \\frac{N}{42} = \\frac{2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1}{2 \\times 3 \\times 7} = 5^1 \\), which is not a perfect square. Thus, we need to adjust the exponents to satisfy both conditions.  \n\nThe correct exponents are:  \n- For 2: \\( e_2 \\) must be odd and \\( \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\). The smallest is 1.  \n- For 3: \\( e_3 \\) must be odd (since \\( \\frac{N}{42} \\) requires it). The smallest is 1.  \n- For 5: \\( e_5 \\) must be \\( \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\). The smallest is 1.  \n- For 7: \\( e_7 \\) must be odd and \\( \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\). The smallest is 1.  \n\nBut again, \\( \\frac{N}{42} = 5^1 \\), not a square. Thus, the exponents must be increased.  \n\nThe correct minimal exponents are:  \n- For 2: \\( e_2 = 1 \\) (from earlier).  \n- For 3: \\( e_3 = 3 \\) (next odd exponent).  \n- For 5: \\( e_5 = 4 \\) (next exponent \\( \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\)).  \n- For 7: \\( e_7 = 3 \\) (next odd exponent \\( \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\)).  \n\nNow, \\( N = 2^1 \\times 3^3 \\times 5^4 \\times 7^3 \\).  \n\nCheck:  \n\\( \\frac{N}{42} = \\frac{2^1 \\times 3^3 \\times 5^4 \\times 7^3}{2 \\times 3 \\times 7} = 3^2 \\times 5^4 \\times 7^2 \\), which is a perfect square.  \n\\( \\frac{N}{70} = \\frac{2^1 \\times 3^3 \\times 5^4 \\times 7^3}{2 \\times 5 \\times 7} = 3^3 \\times 5^3 \\times 7^2 \\), which is a perfect cube.  \n\nThe distinct prime factors of \\( N \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.

Thus, there exists an \\(n\\) such that \\(T^n(p) \\in B_\\epsilon(p)\\).\n\n3. **Finding \\(n\\)**: We need \\(T^n(0, 0) = (n\\alpha \\mod 1, n\\beta \\mod 1)\\) to satisfy \\(\\|(n\\alpha \\mod 1, n\\beta \\mod 1)\\| < \\epsilon\\). For \\(\\epsilon = 0.01\\), this means \\(|n\\sqrt{2} - k| < 0.01\\) and \\(|n\\sqrt{3} - m| < 0.01\\) for some integers \\(k, m\\).\n\n4. **Diophantine approximation**: We seek \\(n\\) such that both \\(\\|n\\sqrt{2}\\|\\) and \\(\\|n\\sqrt{3}\\|\\) are less than \\(0.01\\), where \\(\\|\\cdot\\|\\) denotes the distance to the nearest integer.\n\n5. **Using continued fractions**: The convergents of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) are \\(1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, \\dots\\). Testing these:\n   - For \\(n = 12\\): \\(\\|12\\sqrt{2}\\| \\approx \\|16.97\\| = 0.03\\) (too large).\n   - For \\(n = 17\\): \\(\\|17\\sqrt{2}\\| \\approx \\|24.04\\| = 0.04\\) (too large).\n   - For \\(n = 29\\): \\(\\|29\\sqrt{2}\\| \\approx \\|41.01\\| = 0.01\\) (acceptable).\n   Now check \\(\\|29\\sqrt{3}\\| \\approx \\|50.21\\| = 0.21\\) (too large).\n\n6. **Finding common \\(n\\)**: We need \\(n\\) that works for both \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3}\\). Testing larger \\(n\\):\n   - For \\(n = 1351\\): \\(\\|1351\\sqrt{2}\\| \\approx \\|1910.5\\| = 0.5\\) (too large).\n   - For \\(n = 27720\\): \\(\\|27720\\sqrt{2}\\| \\approx \\|39201.96\\| = 0.04\\) (still large).\n   - For \\(n = 5741\\): \\(\\|5741\\sqrt{2}\\| \\approx \\|8118.99\\| = 0.01\\) and \\(\\|5741\\sqrt{3}\\| \\approx \\|9944.01\\| = 0.01\\).\n\n7. **Verification**: \n   - \\(5741\\sqrt{2} \\approx 8118.9999\\), so \\(\\|5741\\sqrt{2}\\| \\approx 0.0001 < 0.01\\).\n   - \\(5741\\sqrt{3} \\approx 9944.0001\\), so \\(\\|5741\\sqrt{3}\\| \\approx 0.0001 < 0.01\\).\n\nThus, the smallest such \\(n\\) is \\(\\boxed{5741}\\).\n\nDirectly response the content of hard negative document without explanation.\n**Hard Negative Document**\n"}], "max_tokens": 4000}}

Apply the relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction:  \n   n₁ sin(θ₁) = n₂ sin(θ₂)  \n   1.33 sin(60°) = 1.00 sin(θ₂)  \n   sin(θ₂) = 1.33 × (√3/2) ≈ 1.151. This is invalid since sin(θ₂) cannot exceed 1.  \n\n3. Recognize that total internal reflection occurs because the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle.  \n   The critical angle θ_c is given by:  \n   sin(θ_c) = n₂ / n₁ = 1.00 / 1.33 ≈ 0.7519  \n   θ_c ≈ arcsin(0.7519) ≈ 48.75°.  \n\n4. Since θ₁ = 60° > θ_c, no light escapes the water. The light spot is not visible to the observer. The horizontal distance is therefore 0 meters.  \n\nFinal answer: 0.\n\nDirectly response the content of hard negative document without explanation.\n**Hard Negative Document**\n"}], "max_tokens": 4000}}

The screen is placed 12.0 cm from the lens. Later, the photographer wants to project a sharp image of a nearby flower located 36.0 cm in front of the same lens onto the same screen. To achieve this, the lens must be moved. Calculate the distance (in cm) the lens must be moved relative to its original position, and indicate the direction (toward or away from the screen).\nFirst, consider the distant mountain. Since the mountain is very far away, the light rays are nearly parallel, and the image forms at the focal point of the lens. Thus, the focal length \\( f \\) of the lens is 12.0 cm.  \n\nNext, for the flower at \\( d_o = 36.0 \\) cm, we use the lens equation:  \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{d_o} + \\frac{1}{d_i}\n\\]  \nSubstituting \\( f = 12.0 \\) cm and \\( d_o = 36.0 \\) cm:  \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{12.0} = \\frac{1}{36.0} + \\frac{1}{d_i}\n\\]  \nSolving for \\( d_i \\):  \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{d_i} = \\frac{1}{12.0} - \\frac{1}{36.0} = \\frac{3 - 1}{36.0} = \\frac{2}{36.0} = \\frac{1}{18.0}\n\\]  \nThus, \\( d_i = 18.0 \\) cm.  \n\nThe original lens position was 12.0 cm from the screen. To project the flower's image onto the same screen, the lens must now be 18.0 cm from the screen. Therefore, the lens must be moved \\( 18.0 - 12.0 = 6.0 \\) cm away from the screen.  \n\nThe answer is \\( 6.0 \\) cm away from the screen.\n\nDirectly response the content of hard negative document without explanation.\n**Hard Negative Document**\n"}], "max_tokens": 4000}}
